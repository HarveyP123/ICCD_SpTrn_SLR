1. Link prediction & SLR
Folder `SLR_Link_Pred` is the folder for SLR training for link prediction, which follows dense training -> reweight training -> sparse training procedure. 

1.Node classification & SLR
Folder `SLR_Link_Pred` is the folder for SLR training for node classification, which follows dense training -> reweight training -> sparse training procedure.
